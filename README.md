# Person Page

A simple personal bio site forked from [github.com/jlord/person-page](github.com/jlord/person-page). All social media widgets have been removed.

This is a [Fork-n-Go](http://www.jlord.github.io/forkngo) project, so fork to get started making your own.

See the demo at [jlord.github.io/person-page](http://jlord.github.io/person-page).

## Create your own

| You'll Need: |   |
| ------------ | - |
| [GitHub](http://www.github.com/signup) account | Basic [HTML](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) |

### First, fork this repository.

Click the fork button in the upper right. Now you have a copy of this repository on your GitHub account!

### Rename your fork

Once you've forked it, click on Settings and rename your fork, because probably `person-page` is not what you want in your URL. Name your new repository: `username.github.io` (but make `username` your username, for instance, I'd use `jlord.github.io`). GitHub will host all website files on the `master` branch of a repo with that account name convention. Woo! More info on that at [pages.github.com](http://www.pages.github.com).

You can also give it any 'ol name and GitHub will host it using this patter: `username.github.io/reponame`.

### Style

There are basic styles included in `style.css` but go wild and make it your own, try other things!

### Bonus Style

There is another style, on the `lines` branch. To access this style however you'll need to use your Terminal or GitHub desktop app to delete `gh-pages` and then rename `lines` to `gh-pages`.
